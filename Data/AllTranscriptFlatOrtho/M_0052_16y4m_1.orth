An um uh, HU I did have a tutor, erm but in about, H AROUND September um he just {blocks}um SSS STOPPED coming, didn't turn up for some reason, and WO W WU we found out A A couple of months ago his wife's got cancer, so um so HEE HE’S going to stop for a bit. And um, well HI I HA A ASN’T been as fun um playing since he hasn't been teaching me, because when I learn songs by myself it takes a bit longer, and isn’t quite as fun. And um, well, M MOST of the SO SONGS I play is like rock, and hard rock, and um my favourite band are { blocks}HU U OBABLY QUEEN QUEEN, and um, HI HIXEPT that I find most of their songs QUITE QUITE hard to play.
