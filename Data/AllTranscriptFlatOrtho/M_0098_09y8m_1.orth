TODAY at school um we went to the computer room and we had to do um some spread SHEETS stuff. WHAT flavour no what um eye colour have you got and WHAT WHAT colour hair, HOW many pets have you got. And some people um have about two pets and some of them had one and some of them had none so we just put zero in the sheets. {block} Then today at school too I played football too and we was playing versus 5H and it was a draw the match it was three-three. AND I scored one goal and then um someone else scored again. And today um I watched POKEMON on TV AND it was about this boy Ash and um this one girl Misty and Rock. They was going in this adventure to find um there's one hundred and fifty Pokemons they have to find found. SO they went to this um white house. AND you see when they went inside it they saw this animal um I think it's uh it's a it's a beetle I CAN’T I CAN’T remember and um and it could talk but it wasn't a real beetle it was a boy inside this costume
