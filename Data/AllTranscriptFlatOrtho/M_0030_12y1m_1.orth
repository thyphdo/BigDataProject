{T1} Most of the programming I do is in visual basic um, which is in windows. Um, at my school they've got visual basic, and I sometimes spend some time writing in there, in our I.T. lessons, information technology. Um um there were few samples, um supplied from visual basic and, I picked up some the techniques from that, with all the add-ons and everything, it's really a very U USER friendly language and easy to use. Um, at home I've actually got a higher version of visual basic than at school, um but the computer sometimes crashes when it runs that, I think it's because of memory problems. Um, yeah. And I've made some EXE versions of some of my games, um but I'm keeping those to myself F FOR the time, I might sell them later when I'm older. Um. {T2} what sort of games have you written? {T1} Usually a strategy games, um, I've written a program where you’ve got to fill in some magic squares, and I've got a program to actually make a magic square any size you want. Once I made one twentynine by twentynine, took ages fill it. {T2} magic square, that's the one where you move the {T1} no, um that’s when where all the horizontals and verticals and diagonals add up to the same. {T2} right {T1} Um, one twenty nine by twenty nine looks impossible but in fact it's based on one simple technique, um make it any size as long as the dimension is an odd number, haven't tried it with an even number yet. Um, oh yes visual basic. Um, M M MOST of my friends at school who are in yearsSSSSSSS higher than me, sometimes write programs in visual basic in their lunch breaks. Um some of them are a bit annoying but I I I get used to that. Try to push me off computers and everything. Um. {T2}. {T1} Yeah. Um, my account on the computers is a normal one, you can get {block}manager accounts above that, A AND they can go into anyone else's below them.
