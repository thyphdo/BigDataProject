Right, I'm going to talk about fencing for a bit. Um I started fencing a couple of years ago. There are three W{blocks}W W W WEAPONS foil, epee and sabre. I started off on foil, um, and that was ok um but I didn’t feel it WUZSSSSSSSSS um as interesting as some of the others, so I started doing a bit of epee after a while. And I IN epee you've got to hit your opponent with the end of the swords absolutely anywhere, basically. Um, and I ITS all done with um C C{blocks}OMPUTERS and um YYYYYOU all wired up to stuff, WHICHCHCHCHCHCH um C{blocks}AN tell if you’ve hit  the other person or not. And um {block}THERE’S a metal foil often, which means that light doesn't come up if you hit the floor. And um, I've entered a few competitions, I did quite well, um about a year ago when I came SSSSSSEVENTH in Surrey, um which wasn't bad. Um, I've not been doing it so much recently though, but I have done a bit of sabre, um most of our school fencing competitions are sabre rather than epee, erm which is a bit of a pain because it's mostly loads of inexperienced people WHO JUST WILL WHO JUST hit you, and I would always wake up the next day with all these bruises, um and bleeding a bit. Erm I’ve entered a couple of sabre competitions as well, um I'm not generally very good at sabre because I don't really practise it, but once I got to the last sixteen of the public school fencing competitions, which I thougth  wasn’t bad. Um, dee dum dee dum. Erm, I don't think I'm realistically going  to be able to keep fencing up at University, BECAUSSSSS there's other things that I probably want to do instead, I'm not sure I'll have the time, but I’ll probably enter the public schools again this year
