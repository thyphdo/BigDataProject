And then, and then uhm do you see the other the next, uhm, the first day we were trying for our greens, I got my green, but the most hardest is to get your red, but, uhm, you see my sister, they said that I can't get my green, I will never get my green and then I did, I showed them that I did. And then uhm, and then I was, I was trying trying to get my blue, we were having a test to get a blue, but I failed, I failed, but, but uhm, I didn't mind, anyway, I didn't mind, because I got my green. And, uhm, and that's it. ({T2} Tell me about your school). School. Uhm, you see our school, you see now, at our school I'm in year six, and uhm, um I like to play football at school, and basketball, and uhm, you see you see our foot you see our footballers playing against the year five, year six versus year five, and then, and then, and then, the score was 2-1, we beat them, and I um must ?.
