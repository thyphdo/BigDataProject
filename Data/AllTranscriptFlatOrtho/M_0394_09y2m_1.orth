Um, really, last holiday I went to America to see my auntie and uncle.  And um, she has a cat and three dogs, it SSSOAwiming pool.  And we went to the ice-cream parlour a lot and um but it was so hot over there um the ice-cream M{x6} MA MELTED.  But my F FAVOUROTE part is when we went to this um, water park and there was this big wave machine and one wave came every er one second, er I mean, I mean every five M M MINUTES and it was a big tidal wave and it went over my dad's head, so it was really tall.  Um, I, there was once when I was taking Laddy, a dog, out for a walk and we, and then we saw this big hornet, well it wasn't a hornet, it was CH TWICE as big as a hornet.  And it landed right in F F FRONT of  LLLADDY, the dog, and we um, I just ran up the hill and LL LADDY just sat there puzzled.  Um, when I got to the car park I realised I hadn't had L LADDY with me and he was still down there with that thing.  So I had to WALK WALK bravely down there and get him again.  Um, we also SSAwam in the lake.
