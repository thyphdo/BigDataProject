I  like  to  play  football  for  fun,  and  because  I  like  to  play  for  fun,  I  normally  BE  on  the  football  team  and  one  thing  I  like  to  be  on  the  football  team,  because  you  have  to  LISTEN  and  hear  what  the  coach  is  going to tell  you  er I  don't  know  what  to  say!  Er er my  favourite  SPORT is  TO  um SWIM  because  when  you  swim,  you  get  more  ENERGY  in  you  and  after  you  swim  you  have  to  TAKE  a  SHOWER  and  rinse  off  the that  thing  in  the  water. 

{Prompted by interviewer}  er  er er I  don't  know  what  to  say  about  computer  games! {Prompted by interviewer}    I  don't  have a  football  team,  I  like  any  team! {Prompted by interviewer}   My  best  place  I  ever  been,  was  to  er LEGOLAND.  After  we  WENT  there,  the  next  holiday  we  went  to  CHESSINGTON  and  then  the  Easter  holidays  we  went  to  Thorpe  Park  in  the  MORNING  and  we 	 CAME  back  something  to  nine  in  the  afternoon.  And the rides was fun.  My  favourite  ride  was  the  scary  ride,  where  you  have  to  go  ON  this  ride  and  you  have  to  go  upside  down.
