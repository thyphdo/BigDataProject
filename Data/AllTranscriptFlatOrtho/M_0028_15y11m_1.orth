I've supported Aston VILLA VILLA for eight years. I supported them in 1990, when my uncle died. When I was going through his house, I found a couple of badges with Aston Villa on, and some memorabilia. Since then, I've supported them, er, I've supported them through thick and thin, last couple of seasons have been bad, this season doing really well. We’ve bought in England stars, WE’VVVVVVVVVV got tHen players from England, in our squad, or first team mainly are foreigners, Mark Bosnich who’s going to go. Um. AT THE AT THE moment at school I'm doing my GCSEs, I chose Business Studies, Geography, double science, English Maths, er French, English Literature and language, erm, I'm doing all high papers in everything. Er so far, I've had my Geography, that went really well, found that really easy. Er, my RE er didn't do too well in that, because couldn't really learn nothing. My MATHSSSSSSS that was really hard, all the things I studied on didn't  turn up, didn’t come up. And then on my Technology I learned everything, that was really hard, I didn't really understand all of it. And tomorrow I have Maths, and Science again, SAME SAME day as I had on Friday, had Maths and Science then. Science I found that really easy, all multiple choices. So hopefully I'll do well and just get good mock results.
