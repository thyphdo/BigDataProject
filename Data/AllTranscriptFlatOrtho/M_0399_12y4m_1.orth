I like um quite a lot of sports most sports really but my favourite is tennis. I play quite a lot in the week, and all the time on the weekends. At school they don't really do much tennis, but (ER) at school they do um wide variety of sports, such as football, rugby, athletics, an cricket. I'm in all those teams, apart from athletics which I don't really like. In rugby I play inside centre, which is um really kind of (ER) forward, but erm helps at the back as well, midfield if you're talking football wise. In football I'm a defender, and I play for the school team as well. In cricket I'm not really er a bowler, but I can bowl quite well, quite accurately, I'm more of a batter, and my favourite bat is the v sixhundred by Slazenger. Hu at school my favourite SSSSUBJECT is science, and I like that because you get to find out a wide variety of things. I I I like maths um quite a lot as well, I don't know why I just like it. And um my worst subject is probably English or Latin. I don't like Latin ‘cause very hard, and English I'm just not very good at. Um, at home, I like to play on the computer a lot. I have a playstation, and an n64 my favourite’s the playstation, which I have lots of games on. I like playing on the pc, especially on the internet. I’ve my own e-mail addresses, and I'm hoping to get my er new website done, um, later this year. On the playstation my favourite game is DU DU DU DU DU WWF smackdown which is a wrestling game, which is quite a recent one. Mum {block}W W ONE my favourite games is resident evil three, it is very gory and has lots of blood. On the n64 my favourite game is James Bond G GO GAR GOLDENEYE, which IZ{block}IZ based on the film erm with Pierce Brosnan starring as James Bond.
