A U U AND I'll B BE talking about er what is the difference BETWEEN BETWEEN er cricket and football. A AND West Indies were in dire straits yesterday, and they had thirty one for six wickets. And for the last few years, the West Indies er team HHHHHAS been declining in form, like for instance they’ve beaten by Pakistan three nil, beaten by England, er beaten by England in the last test match, but they still won it, we still won the test, three two. THEY GOT B- THEY BEATEN by South Africa three nil, and they got beaten by who else, er I'm not sure now. Oh, u um, um, I’m back to football now. Er, I support Wimbledon, er A AND Wimbledon u u yeah a bit more money, and er, we're only tenth and the worst position was fifteenth, {block}LAST season, and but er for the last few SEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEROUT we’ve been selling some good players like Vinnie Jones, but, u WE WE wanted to sell for years, er for SSSSSSSSIXSHU- SIXHUNDREDANDFIFTY thousand, er WE WE sold er u I see, Homesworth, two million to Bolton, and for the last few years, er so it was probably last week, {block}I just heard that West Indies were beaten five nil, BY BY Arsenal last season. This season were beaten by the bottom four, all three were beaten by er NNNOTTINGHAM Forest, three one, Blackburn three one, Southampton two nil, and Charlton three one.
