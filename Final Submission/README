## Note

In order to run this script:

    1. all .wav file should be already processed into .csv file 
    2. This script should be in the same folder with all .csv files listed in 'filename' list 
    
The algorithms are performed based on the following assumptions:
    
    1. The wave data (after PDA step) is compressed to a list of 20x4 matrix. 20 rows is chosen by the MFCC normalize algorithm and 4 features is chosen as the component number at PDA step. These two parameters can be modified.
    
    2. The 20x4 matrix is flattened (reshape) to a 80-element list. Data X is a 203 rows of a single column containing a list of 80 element.
